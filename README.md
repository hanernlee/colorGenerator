##Color Gradient Generator

#Problem
The app should generate a gradient color based on two hex color inputs.

#Solution
There are currently two versions of solution to this problem, one using toString() with parseInt() and the other without any of those methods to convert the hexadecimal values.

Feel free to check out both JS files for the solution. The live app currently runs on app2.js, without toString() and parseInt() methods.

#Features
You can immediately utilise the app by entering a 6 digit color code without '#', (eg. FFFFFF or 009688).
