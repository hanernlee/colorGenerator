##Color Gradient Generator

#Problem
The app should generate a gradient color based on two hex color inputs.

#Solutions
There are 2 variations to this problem one using toString() with parseInt() and the other without any of those methods to convert the hexadecimal numbers.

Feel free to check out both JS files for the solution. The live app currently utilises app2.js without toString() and parseInt() methods.
